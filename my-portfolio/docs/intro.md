# Welcome to My Technical Portfolio

Hi, I'm Denis Cabrera — a cloud and cybersecurity professional passionate about automation, secure architecture, and AI.

This site is my personal knowledge base and portfolio, where I document and share:

- 🚀 **Hands-on cloud and security projects** built with real AWS services, Terraform, and other tools  
- 📚 **Cheat sheets** for cloud, security, scripting, and certifications  
- 🧠 **Study notes** and technical walkthroughs from labs, bootcamps, and self-study  
- ✍️ **Blog posts** exploring cloud security topics, emerging threats, and automation strategies  

This space evolves as I learn and grow in cloud security, DevSecOps, and AI-assisted security tooling.  
Everything here is built, written, or explored by me — to solidify my knowledge and share with the community.

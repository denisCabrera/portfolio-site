# 🧠 Denis Cabrera's Portfolio Site

Welcome to my technical portfolio and knowledge base. This site showcases my hands-on work in **cloud security**, **automation**, and **AI integration**. It includes projects, cheat sheets, study notes, and technical blogs — all built and documented by me.

Built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), this site is designed to be clean, searchable, and useful as both a reference and a showcase.
